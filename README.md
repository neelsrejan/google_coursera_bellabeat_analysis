### Abstract
The project is part of the googlge coursera data analytics capstone project. The goal of the project is to use the fitbit data from: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit to find trends among the data. The trends identified should provide insight into how users use their fitbit and what meaningful insights can be used by bellabeat to better their own products. I chose to help improve the bellabeat app. Exploratory data analysis was done in T-SQL and queries can be found. I used certain results from queries in the resulting presentation. Enjoy the insights!

### Data
The data that was used in the analysis found in the presentation can be found in the T-SQL queries. The queries joined together to make the Steps, Calories, Heartrate, Intensity, and METs per hour were: 24, 21, 18, 22, and 28. The queries joined together to make the Steps, Calories, Heartrate, Intensity, METs, and Sleep per day of the week were: 5, 11, 19, 23, 29, and 34. These were combined to form queries 46 and 47 which gave the tables that were imported into excel as well as 48 as the global averages for the above mentioned fields. For the correlations, results from queries: 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, and 45 were used in the final presentation. 

## Figures
The above mentioned results from the queries were saved as excel files and connected to using Tableau. The consequential graphs and charts were made and added into the final presentaion. The dynamic charts and dashboard can be properly viewed at the following link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/neel.srejan/viz/bellabeat_dashboard/BellabeatAnalysis?publish=yes. 

## Comments
This was my first proper data analyst project and hope to do plenty more in the future, any feedback would be appreciated. Thank you!
